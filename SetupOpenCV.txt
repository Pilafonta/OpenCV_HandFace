#OpenCV

#Installation:

Install using Homebrew: (Note that this may take a while)

`brew tap homebrew/science`

Then,

`brew install opencv`

Also, it might fail to install some dependencies, so try to install them independently
and then run `brew install opencv` again.

After installation is done, you can find the openCV libraries at `/usr/local/lib`

##Xcode Set up

###Set up for every project:
* In your projects build settings search for `search paths`
* In the `Header Search Paths` add the following two lines
  * `\usr\local\include`
  * `\usr\local\lib`
* In the `Library Search Paths` add `\user\local\lib`
* In the `Build Phases -> Link Binary with Libraries`
  click the `+` and then `add other...` press / and type in
  `\usr\local\lib` add `libopencv_imgproc` and `libopencv_core`

Then you need to link the library files for the parts of opencv
you're importing into your project.

### Initial XCode Setup:
After you're done with the set up above, it might not work right away,
and throw you an error saying a certain library wasn't found in `/usr/local/lib`.

Look at the Xcode error logs, when you try to run.

To fix this:

* Run `mdfind libraryname`
* Then `sudo ln -s locationOfLibrary/library.dylib /usr/local/lib/library.dylib`

Example: `sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/ilmbase/2.1.0/lib/libIexMath-2_1.11.dylib /usr/local/lib/libIexMath-2_1.11.dylib`
